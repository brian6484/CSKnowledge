## Diff between regression and classification
It depends on the type of value that we are trying to predict. Regression is for continuous value whilst classification is
for discrete value (0 vs 1, true or false, etc).

## Multi-class
Multi-class classification is when there are 2 or more classes to be classified. For example, if data given is cats, people
and cats, and we are trying to infer what this incoming image data is, that is multi-class classification.
