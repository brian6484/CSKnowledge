## @Where
Adding this at the entity acts as a *global filter* for hibernate queries.
This means that whenever u fetch this Post entity, this query (where deleted_at is null ) is automatically added to the query.
It is normally for soft delete purposes, where u dont wanna fetch the posts that have deleted_at = null

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "post")
@Where(clause = "deleted_at IS NULL")  // Automatically applies this condition to queries
@SQLDelete(sql = "UPDATE post SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = ?")
public class Post extends BaseTimeEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String title;
    private String content;
    
    private LocalDateTime deleted_at; // Soft delete column
}
```
