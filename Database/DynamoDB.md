## Suitable for real-time systems
Provide by AWS, DynamoDB is a NoSQL db that fits well.

## Low latency
DynammoDB is guaranteed to have a single digit read/write times. This is partly due to SSD backed storage that
allows fast,consistent reads.

## High throughput and scalability
During traffic spikes, it scales automatically unlike regular sql like postgre that needs manual sharding and
replication.

## serverless and high availability
No need to manage servers and if one data center fails, it can route traffic to another dc.
