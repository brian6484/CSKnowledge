## JVM
It is part of JRE that provides a runtime environment to allow execution of java bytecode (.class files). This is what
makes Java platform-independent (write once, run everywhere). It compiles bytecode to machine code for underlying hardware
and also manages memory via garbage collection.

**VERY IMPT**. I thought JVM converts java source code to bytecode but read my JDK point. It is the java compiler (javac) that
does this. JVM just executes bytecode.

## JRE
It is a package that provides everything to run a java application. It includes the jvm, libaries.

## JDK
It is sdk that provides everything to develop java applications. Whilst JRE is only to **run** a java app, JDK is for developers
where it has java compiler (javac that converts java source code to bytecode), debuggers, etc.
