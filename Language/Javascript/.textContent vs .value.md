## Intro
To understand the diff between those 2, we first need to understand the diff between text content and form fields. Text content is mainly for 
display on a web page, where **it is not intended for user input**. But form fields are meant for user inputs.

## docoument.getElement("hola").textContent
So when it is mainly text content and no user input is meant to manipulate the displayed data, we use .textContent.

## docoument.getElement("hola").value
But when it is a form field that explicitly require user input, we use value

## Personal example
So I wanted to get a value from my modal, which is a GUI that appears on top of the main content of a webpage. That value
is some package ID. That value is just plain text field but I used value instead of textContent, so "undeclared" is assigned
to my variable instead of the value that I want. O nce I understood the diff between those 2, when I switched to .textContent,
the error was fixed.
