## Traditional way to write function
was like java
```js
// Traditional Function Expression
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## arrow function
is like a lambda function in py/java where we put parameters in (brackets) and use a arrrow literally like => and declare
function body.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
