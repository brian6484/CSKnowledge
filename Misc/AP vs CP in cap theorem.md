## Confusion
i always get confused with AP and CP.

## Partition = Network Split

### Simple Definition:
A **partition** means parts of your distributed system **can't talk to each other** due to network failure.

### Visual Example with chess game:

```
NORMAL (No Partition):
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Server A  │ ←──✓──→ │   Server B  │
│  (US-West)  │         │  (US-East)  │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
     ↓                       ↓
  Users can                Users can
  play chess              play chess
```

```
PARTITION (Network cable cut, router failure, etc.):
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│   Server A  │ ←──✗──→ │   Server B  │
│  (US-West)  │  SPLIT! │  (US-East)  │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
     ↓                       ↓
  Users here              Users here
  can't sync              can't sync
```

### Real-World Causes:
- Fiber optic cable cut
- Router/switch failure
- Data center loses internet connectivity
- Cloud region goes down
- Firewall misconfiguration

---

### The CAP Problem During Partition:

**You MUST choose:**

1. **Consistency (C)**: Wait for partition to heal, ensure all nodes agree
   - Consequence: **System becomes unavailable** (can't serve requests safely)

2. **Availability (A)**: Keep serving requests from isolated nodes
   - Consequence: **Nodes might have different data** (inconsistent)

---

### Chess Example:

**Partition happens between US-West and US-East servers:**

- **If CP**: Both regions stop accepting games until reconnected
- **If AP**: Both regions keep running games, leaderboards diverge temporarily, sync later

so for chess game system, it should be AP. 

**That's why we choose AP** - keep games running even if leaderboards are temporarily inconsistent!
