A Sorted Set (ZSET) is fundamentally a two-column structure for its data entries: Member and Score. The third term, the Key, is just the identifier for the whole set itself. Basically, each member has a score (number) and is auto sorted by score.

## chess matchmaking queue for example
#### **ZADD** - Add member with score to that key (matchmaking_queue)
```redis
ZADD matchmaking_queue 1850 user_123
      â””â”€key name        â””â”€score â””â”€member

# Adds user_123 with ELO score 1850
```

#### **ZRANGEBYSCORE** - Get members in score range
```redis
ZRANGEBYSCORE matchmaking_queue 1800 1900
               â””â”€key name        â””â”€min â””â”€max

# Returns all users with ELO between 1800-1900
# Result: [user_456, user_123, user_789]
```

#### **ZREM** - Remove member
```redis
ZREM matchmaking_queue user_123 user_789
     â””â”€key name        â””â”€members to remove

# Deletes user_123 and user_789 from queue
```

#### ZRANGE for fifo
```
ZADD queue 1697123400 user_123  # timestamp when they joined
ZADD queue 1697123405 user_456  # 5 seconds later
ZADD queue 1697123410 user_789  # 5 seconds later

ZRANGE queue 0 -1
â†’ [user_123, user_456, user_789]  # FIFO order!
```

## ZRANGE - Get Members by Rank Position

### Syntax:
```redis
ZRANGE key start stop
```

**Returns members by their rank (position), not by score.**

---

### ZRANGE queue 0 -1 Explained:

```redis
ZRANGE queue 0 -1
       â””â”€key â””â”€â”¬â”€ â””â”€â”¬â”€
            start stop
```

- **`0`** = first member (lowest score)
- **`-1`** = last member (highest score)
- **Result:** All members from start to end

---

### Example:

```redis
# Queue has:
# carol: 1480
# alice: 1500
# bob: 1520

ZRANGE queue 0 -1
â†’ [carol, alice, bob]  # All members, sorted by score

ZRANGE queue 0 0
â†’ [carol]  # Just first (rank 0)

ZRANGE queue 1 2
â†’ [alice, bob]  # Ranks 1-2

ZRANGE queue 0 1
â†’ [carol, alice]  # First 2 members
```

---

### Difference from ZRANGEBYSCORE:

| Command | What it uses | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **ZRANGEBYSCORE** | Score range | `ZRANGEBYSCORE queue 1450 1550` (ELO between 1450-1550) |
| **ZRANGE** | Rank position | `ZRANGE queue 0 9` (top 10 members) |

---

### Common Uses:

```redis
# Get top 10 players (leaderboard):
ZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 9  # REV = reverse (highest first)

# Get all members:
ZRANGE queue 0 -1
```

**`-1` in Redis = "last element"** (like Python slicing!)

---

### Example Flow:
```redis
## queue
ZADD queue 1500 alice      # alice: 1500 ELO
ZADD queue 1520 bob        # bob: 1520 ELO  
ZADD queue 1480 carol      # carol: 1480 ELO

ZRANGEBYSCORE queue 1450 1550
â†’ [carol, alice, bob]      # All in range, sorted by score

ZREM queue alice bob       # Match them, remove from queue

## Leaderboard
ZADD leaderboard 2500 user_123    # score=ELO, member=user_id
ZADD leaderboard 2300 user_456
ZADD leaderboard 2700 user_789
ZADD leaderboard 2100 user_999

ZREVRANGE leaderboard 0 9
â†’ [user_789, user_123, user_456, ...]
  # Returns user IDs, sorted by ELO descending
```

---

**TL;DR:**
- `ZADD` = insert
- `ZRANGEBYSCORE` = query by score range  
- `ZREM` = delete

Done! ðŸŽ¯


Yes, in the original example provided by Server C, there are **two** distinct Sorted Sets (ZSETs) being used as secondary indexes:

1.  **`posts:by_reactions`**: A Sorted Set where the **score** is the reaction count (e.g., $8$ likes). This set is used to get the posts ranked by **popularity**.
2.  **`posts:by_time`**: A Sorted Set where the **score** is the Unix timestamp (e.g., $1706178600$). This set is used to get the posts ranked by **recency**.

***

### Summary of Server C

Server C is essentially running a small indexing service using these two data structures to answer two common questions efficiently:

| Index Key | Redis Type | Score Represents | Query Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`posts:by_reactions`** | **ZSET** | Total Likes/Reactions | "What are the **most popular** posts?" |
| **`posts:by_time`** | **ZSET** | Unix Timestamp | "What are the **most recent** posts?" |

Using two separate ZSETs is the standard way to support multiple sorting criteria for the same underlying data (the posts).
