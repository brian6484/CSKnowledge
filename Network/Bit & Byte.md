## Bit
holds either 0/1 value 

## Byte
its a grouping of these 8 bits and basic unit of storage in most computers

Why the 8-bit grouping is so significant:

* **Representation:** With 8 bits, you can represent $2^8 = 256$ different possible values (from 0 to 255).
* **Characters (ASCII):** Historically, 256 values was enough to encode a single letter, number, or symbol using character encoding standards like **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). This is the main reason why the byte became the universal standard for measuring data.
* **Data Size:** When you see a file size in **Kilobytes (KB), Megabytes (MB),** or **Gigabytes (GB)**, those prefixes are always referring to groups of bytes.

Think of it like this:

| Unit | Size | Analogy |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Bit** | A single 0 or 1 | A single light switch (on/off) |
| **Byte** | **8 bits** | A single letter on a page |
| **Kilobyte** | $\approx 1000$ Bytes | A short text email |
| **Megabyte** | $\approx 1$ Million Bytes | A typical song file |
