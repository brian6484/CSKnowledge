## HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol is *application-layer protocol* that transfers resources (html,json,images,etc).

1) client sends request (like GET /index.html HTTP/1.1) to server over TCP (protocol depends on HTTP version, if HTTP/3 it
uses QUIC/UDP but most of the time, it usues TCP)
2) server responds with status code (like 200 OK) and payload
3) Stateless: every request is independent
4) Modern web uses HTTP/2(multiplexing) and HTTP/3(QUIC/UDP). [More here]()

## HTTP methods
The commonly seen methods are get, post, delete and put

## Diff between GET vs POST
GET retrieves data from server and **can be cached by browsers or CDNs with Cache-Control headers** unlike POST. It is also
safe and idempotent (making same request multiple times doesnt change server state)

POST sends data to server and **isnt usually cached by browsers cuz it changes server state**, although u can technically. Data
is in the **request body, not URL like GET**. And is not idempotent

## The tricky ones
Difference between POST and PUT is that POST is when you are entering new data that doesnt exist yet in db. PUT is used to *edit* the data saved in db.

But what about PATCH? PUT requires **all** data to be passed, even the data that you don't want to change. But with PATCH, you can just edit the data you wanna change 
without being forced to pass all the data. Literally think of LOL game path where just 부분 partial patch of certain data like game updates are called patch and not PUT cuz it is modifying just specific parts of the software, not PUT all data from scratch.
