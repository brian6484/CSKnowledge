## Program
What exactly is a program?

Program is a set of instructions in a programming language
that is stored in a storage device like a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD). It has 2 states - static which means 
static in storage device and not executed yet. But when it is executed, it is executed by the computer's Central
Processing Unit (CPU) and is loaded into the Random Access Memory (RAM) from the storage device. The CPU then 
interprets and executes the instructions in the program. The temporary nature of memory with RAM allows for faster 
access to data and more efficient execution, *rather than directly running from a storage device*.
