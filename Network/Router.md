## Router
It connects multiple networks and forwards packets between them. It examines the destional IP address in each capcket
and determines the best hop by referring to its routing table. It can also handle other functions like firewall filtering,
Network Address Translation(NAT),etc. BTW NAT lets many devices on a **private network to share 1 SINGLE public IP address to
access internet**. It ussually cuz ipv4 addresses are limited so each home device cant have its own public IP
