## Scenarios
### running a binary file (executable)
```
./app.bin
## basically ./ and ur binary file name
```

if u get permission error check file permission via ls -la and add execute permission via chmod +x ./app.bin.

### cant even ssh into server 
u can look [here](https://github.com/brian6484/CSKnowledge/blob/main/Network/Linux/How%20to%20SSH.md)

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ssh_key brian@7.7.7.7

## or with password if it doesnt use key
ssh brian@7.7.7.7
## then it will promt for password input
```

to find ssh private key the common location is
```
ls -la ~/.ssh/
```

to find the config and username
```
## check ssh config 
cat ~/.ssh/config
Host myserver
    HostName 192.168.1.100
    User admin
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Port 22

## check bash history for prev ssh commands
history | grep ssh
```

### ssh, curl, telnet all fail
then check network/routing cuz there might been network issue between me and the server(10.50.2.15). Or could be firewall or that server might be down.

we can check via ip route, which shows routing table and where does network traffic go
```bash
ip route

default via 192.168.1.1 dev wlp3s0 proto dhcp metric 600 
192.168.1.0/24 dev wlp3s0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.1.45 metric 600
```
This shows i am on 192/24 network but that server is in a completely diff subnet

lets check if we have vpn connection via ip link show, which shows network interfaces. 
```
$ ip link show
```

**Result:**
```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: wlp3s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether a4:34:d9:8f:12:c3 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
```
theres no vpn interface like tun0 or wg0

check firewall rule
```
sudo iptables -L -n

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```

### ssh connection refused at port 22 - debug with nmap
Now instead of connection time out, the connection is refused. Then we can check which port this server is open and listening for connections
```bash
$ nmap 10.50.2.15
```

**Result:**
```
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-13 09:47 KST
Nmap scan report for 10.50.2.15
Host is up (0.0023s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered ports
PORT     STATE  SERVICE
22/tcp   closed ssh
80/tcp   open   http
443/tcp  open   https

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 4.67 seconds
```

### changing dns config
go to /etc/hosts file. If the error i cannot resolve hostname (db.internal) and there is no mapping inside this /etc/hosts file, we have to add manually. And the ip address that belongs to this domain can be found via
```
nslookup db.internal
## or
dig db.internal

## but if theres NXDOMAIN error, then ask a teammate lol
** server can't find db.internal: NXDOMAIN
```

```
sh-4.2$ cat /etc/hosts
```

**Result:**
```
127.0.0.1   localhost
127.0.1.1   prod-web-01

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

---

Hmm, no entry for `db.internal`! That's the problem.

There's no mapping telling the server what IP address `db.internal` should resolve to.

Usually you'd see something like:
```
10.50.2.100   db.internal
```
assuming teammate gave us the ip 

### changing dns config of ur internal DNS server
/etc/resolv.conf is the file that tells your system which DNS servers to use for resolving hostnames.

```
/etc/resolve.conf

$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
# Generated by NetworkManager
nameserver 192.168.10.5
nameserver 8.8.8.8
search internal.local
```
so it uses 192 which is our internal dns and if we can ssh into that dns server and edit the /etc/hosts file, then other internal users will not have this problem.

Furthermore, if that server is using dnsmasq, which is a lightweight DNS server for network, after editing the hosts file u also need to reload the service. Thats cuz
dnsmasq caches DNS records in memory, so when you edit /etc/hosts, dnsmasq doesn't automatically know about the changes. You need to restart the service to make it reload the configuration.
```
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

### if theres bastion
```
ssh admin@bastion.company.name
ssh ubuntu@10.0.1.50
```
