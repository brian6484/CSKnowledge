## Common Log path 
normally SYSTEM LOGS are in /var/log.
```
/var/log/syslog          # General system messages
/var/log/auth.log        # Authentication logs
/var/log/kern.log        # Kernel messages
/var/log/apache2/        # Web server logs
/var/log/nginx/          # Another web server
```

but application logs can be anywhere
```
# Application-specific locations
~/.local/share/app/logs/         # User applications
/opt/myapp/logs/                 # Custom installed software
/home/user/app.log              # User's home directory
/tmp/debug.log                  # Temporary logs

# Docker containers
docker logs container_name       # Container logs (not on filesystem)

# Systemd journal (not files!)
journalctl                      # Binary journal, not text files
```

so to find log path, we need to **first check configuration of the app**. Most systemd service files don't directly show log paths. The real value of systemctl cat is finding:

The executable path (so you can check its config)
Environment variables that might affect logging
Whether it uses systemd journal vs files
```
$ systemctl cat apache2

You're absolutely right! In my `systemctl cat apache2` example, there are **no log file paths shown**. That's because systemd service files typically don't specify log locations directly.

Let me show you what you'd actually see and where logs are configured:

## Where logs are actually configured:

### 1. Application's own config files:
```bash
$ grep -r "log" /etc/apache2/
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf:ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf:LogFormat "%v:%p %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %O" vhost_combined
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf:ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf:CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
```

### 2. Environment variables (often in systemd):
```bash
$ systemctl show apache2 --property=Environment
Environment=APACHE_LOG_DIR=/var/log/apache2
```

### 3. Sometimes systemd service files DO have log settings:
```bash
$ systemctl cat some-other-service
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/myapp
StandardOutput=file:/var/log/myapp/output.log
StandardError=file:/var/log/myapp/error.log
# OR
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
```

## Why systemctl cat is still useful for finding logs:

**1. Shows the executable path:**
```bash
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/apachectl start
```
Then you can check that executable's config:
```bash
$ /usr/sbin/apachectl -S  # Shows config file locations
```

**2. Shows if it uses systemd journal:**
```bash
[Service]
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
```
Then logs are in: `journalctl -u servicename`

**3. Shows environment variables:**
```bash
[Service]
Environment=LOG_DIR=/custom/path
```

## Better example where systemd file shows log location:

```bash
$ systemctl cat custom-app
[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/myapp/bin/server
StandardOutput=file:/var/log/myapp/stdout.log
StandardError=file:/var/log/myapp/stderr.log
SyslogIdentifier=myapp
```

So you're correct - most systemd service files don't directly show log paths. The real value of `systemctl cat` is finding:
- The executable path (so you can check its config)
- Environment variables that might affect logging
- Whether it uses systemd journal vs files

The actual log locations are usually in the application's configuration files, which is why the `grep -r "log" /etc/myapp/` step is so important!

# Step 1: How does systemd start it?
systemctl cat apache2
# Shows: ExecStart=/usr/sbin/apachectl start

# Step 2: What does the application itself do?
grep -r "log" /etc/apache2/
# Shows: ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
