They are both init systems, meaning they are the first process the kernel starts (with a Process ID of 1)

## What I Actually Mean by "Simultaneous"

When I say systemd starts services "simultaneously," I mean **concurrently** - they're all in the process of starting at the same time, but the CPU is rapidly switching between them.

so essentially waiting part is done asyncrhonously while cpu starts executing another task. 

## The Real Difference: Blocking vs Non-blocking

**SysV Init (Sequential/Blocking):**
```bash
# SysV waits for each command to FULLY COMPLETE before moving to next
start_networking()     # Init waits here until networking is 100% ready
start_database()       # Only starts after networking is completely done  
start_webserver()      # Only starts after database is completely done
```

**Systemd (Concurrent/Non-blocking):**
```bash
# Systemd starts all processes and lets the CPU scheduler handle them
fork() -> start_networking()    # Starts networking process
fork() -> start_database()      # Starts database process immediately  
fork() -> start_webserver()     # Starts webserver process immediately
# All three processes are now "in progress" - CPU switches between them
```

## How This Works with fork() and exec()

You're absolutely right about fork/exec! Here's what actually happens:

**SysV approach:**
```c
// SysV-style sequential startup
pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
    exec("/etc/init.d/networking start");
}
wait(pid);  // ← BLOCKS here until networking is done!

pid = fork(); 
if (pid == 0) {
    exec("/etc/init.d/database start");
}
wait(pid);  // ← BLOCKS here until database is done!
```

**Systemd approach:**
```c
// Systemd-style concurrent startup
pid1 = fork();
if (pid1 == 0) {
    exec("start networking");
}
// DON'T WAIT! Start next service immediately

pid2 = fork();
if (pid2 == 0) {
    exec("start database");
}
// DON'T WAIT! Start next service immediately

pid3 = fork();
if (pid3 == 0) {
    exec("start webserver");
}

// Now we have multiple child processes running concurrently
// CPU scheduler switches between them
```

## Timeline Comparison

**SysV Timeline:**
```
Time:  0s    5s    10s   15s   20s
       |-----|-----|-----|-----|
       Net   |DB   |Web  |Done |
             |     |     |     |
Total: 20 seconds
```

**Systemd Timeline:**
```
Time:  0s    5s    10s   15s   20s
       |-----|-----|-----|-----|
       Net   ████████████████████  (still starting)
       DB    ████████████████      (finishes at 15s)  
       Web   ████████████          (finishes at 10s)
       Done  |     |     |     |
Total: 8 seconds (when all finish)
```

## CPU Scheduling Reality

You're correct that on a single core:
```
CPU at time slice 1: Running networking process
CPU at time slice 2: Running database process  
CPU at time slice 3: Running webserver process
CPU at time slice 4: Back to networking process
... and so on
```

The key insight is:
- **SysV**: Init process itself waits (blocks) for each service
- **Systemd**: Init starts all services then lets them run concurrently via normal CPU scheduling

## Why This Matters for Boot Time

Many services spend time **waiting for I/O** (disk reads, network setup, etc.), not using CPU:

**SysV:**
- Networking service: 2s CPU + 8s waiting for network card initialization = 10s total
- Database service: waits 10s, then 3s CPU + 7s waiting for disk = 10s more  
- **Total: 20s**

**Systemd:**
- All start at once
- While networking waits for network card, CPU works on database
- While database waits for disk, CPU works on webserver
- **Total: ~10s** (overlapped waiting time)

So you're absolutely right about single CPU execution - the "simultaneousness" is really about **not blocking the init process** and allowing the normal process scheduler to efficiently interleave the work!

Does this clarify the difference between sequential blocking vs concurrent non-blocking startup?
