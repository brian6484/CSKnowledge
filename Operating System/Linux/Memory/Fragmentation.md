Fragmentation is a problem in ""physical" computer memory (not virtual memory cuz virtual moery has a clean and contiguous address space) or storage systems where the available free space is broken up into many small, non-contiguous pieces (fragments). This inefficient use of space can degrade system performance and make it difficult or impossible to satisfy requests for large blocks of memory or storage, even if the total amount of free space is sufficient.

The problem manifests in two primary ways: **internal fragmentation** and **external fragmentation**.

***

## Internal Fragmentation

**Internal fragmentation** occurs when a process or file is allocated a memory block that is **larger** than the actual amount of memory it requested or needs. The unused space within the allocated block is considered wasted because it is "internal" to the block and cannot be used by any other process or file.

* **Cause:** This typically happens in memory management schemes that use **fixed-size blocks or pages** (like paging or fixed-partition allocation). The system must allocate space in multiples of the block size.
* **Example:** If a system uses fixed 4KB pages and a process only needs 3.5KB, it is allocated the entire 4KB page. The remaining **0.5KB is internal fragmentation** and is essentially wasted space until the process releases the entire 4KB page.
* **Impact:** Leads to wasted memory space and a reduced effective memory utilization.

## External Fragmentation

**External fragmentation** occurs when there is enough **total free memory** to satisfy a request, but the free space is divided into many small, non-contiguous blocks (or "holes") scattered throughout the memory or storage. Because the requested memory must be **contiguous** (all in one piece), the request cannot be fulfilled.

* **Cause:** This usually arises from the **dynamic allocation and deallocation** of variable-sized memory blocks over time (like in pure segmentation or dynamic-partition allocation). When processes are loaded and removed, they leave behind holes of different sizes.
* **Example:** A system may have a total of 10MB of free RAM, but it is split into five separate 2MB holes scattered between used blocks. A new process that requests 5MB of contiguous memory cannot be allocated, despite the 10MB total being available.
* **Impact:** Hinders the execution of processes that require large, contiguous blocks, even with ample overall free space, potentially leading to thrashing or system crashes.

## Mitigation

Different memory management techniques are employed to mitigate these issues:

* **To combat Internal Fragmentation:** Schemes that allow for more flexibility in allocation size, such as **dynamic partitioning** or allocating the smallest sufficient block, can help. However, in fixed-size schemes like paging, it's unavoidable but is often minimized by choosing an appropriate page size.
* **To combat External Fragmentation:** Techniques like **compaction** (shuffling the memory contents to combine all the scattered free space into one large contiguous block) are effective but require system overhead. **Paging** and **Segmentation** also help by allowing a process's memory to be non-contiguous in physical memory.
* But i thought paging is what causes external fragmentation.

## External Fragmentation Without Paging

With contiguous memory allocation (no paging), when you load and remove processes of different sizes, you get "holes" of free memory scattered throughout:

```
[Process A][free 3KB][Process B][free 1KB][Process C][free 5KB]
```

Even if you have enough *total* free memory (9KB), you might not be able to load a 7KB process because no single contiguous block is large enough. This is **external fragmentation**.

## How Paging Solves This

With paging:
- Physical memory is divided into fixed-size **frames** (e.g., 4KB each)
- Process memory is divided into fixed-size **pages** (same size)
- Pages can be placed in *any* available frames, in any order

[Process A][free 3KB][Process B][free 1KB][Process C][free 5KB]
```

**With paging from the start**, this would have been organized as:
```
Frame 0 (4KB): Process A - uses FULL 4KB
Frame 1 (4KB): COMPLETELY FREE - full 4KB available
Frame 2 (4KB): Process B - uses FULL 4KB  
Frame 3 (4KB): COMPLETELY FREE - full 4KB available
Frame 4 (4KB): Process C - uses FULL 4KB
Frame 5 (4KB): COMPLETELY FREE - full 4KB available

theres no concept of holes in paging cuz OS reorganises everything into fixed-size frames. Either this whole 4kb frame is used (even when program is just using 3kb) or its not. So this
7Kb can go to frame 1 and frame 3 cuz frame 1 has the full 4kb free, not 3kb.

The frames don't need to be next to each other! The page table maps it all correctly, so the process sees contiguous virtual memory even though physical frames are scattered.

**Result:** Every free frame can be used for any page. No unusable gaps between processes.
