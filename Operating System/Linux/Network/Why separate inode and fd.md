## why
The core reason for separating the **inode** and the **file descriptor (fd)** in Unix-like operating systems is to effectively manage the distinction between a file's **permanent identity** and a process's **temporary use** of it. The **inode** is a permanent, system-wide data structure that holds the file's **metadata** (permissions, size, disk location, etc.), existing even when the file is closed. In contrast, the **file descriptor** is a temporary, per-process integer handle that grants access to an "open file description," which tracks the **dynamic state** of a file, such as the **current read/write offset** and the access mode. This separation is crucial for enabling features like **concurrent access** (two processes reading the same file at different positions) and **hard links** (multiple names pointing to the same file) while also providing a unified interface for accessing various resources, including non-disk entities like sockets and pipes.
