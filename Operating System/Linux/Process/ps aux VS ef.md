Use ps aux when you want to quickly see the top resource consumers (CPU, memory).

-a = show processes for **all users** 

-u = provide user oriented output, showing resource utilisation.

-x = show processes that are not attached to terminal 


Use ps -ef when you need to understand the parent/child relationship between processes (using PPID).

-e = show all processes (its -a and -x combined )

-f=**full-format** listing, which includes parent ppid 

Both `ps aux` and `ps -ef` are used to list all running processes on a Unix-like system, but they differ in their **historical origin** and the **default columns displayed**. 
**`ps aux`** uses the **BSD style** (no dash), providing a user-oriented format that includes **%CPU**, **%MEM**, **VSZ** (Virtual Size), and **RSS** (Physical Memory Size), 
making it ideal for checking system resource usage. **`ps -ef`** uses the **System V style** (with a dash), providing a full-format listing that includes the **PPID** (Parent Process ID), which is better for tracking process lineage and dependencies.
