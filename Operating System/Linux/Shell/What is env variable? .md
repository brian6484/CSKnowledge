## env variable
* **Environment Variables:** These are named values stored within the operating system that affect how processes (running programs) will run. They are a way for a program to get
* configuration settings or information about its operating environment *without* needing them hard-coded. Examples are `$PATH` ,`$HOME`, `$USER`.

## path variable
it is a type of environment variable that tells the shell (like Bash or Zsh) **where to look** for executable programs when you type a command. It contains a list of directories, 
separated by colons (`:`). When you type a command like `ls` or `chmod`, the shell searches each directory listed in the **PATH** until it finds the corresponding program.
