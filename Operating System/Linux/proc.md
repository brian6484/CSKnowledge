## What is `/proc`?

`/proc` is a **virtual filesystem** - it's not real files on disk, it's a window into the kernel's view of running processes.

Think of it like this:
- Your computer's RAM has all the running processes
- `/proc` lets you "peek" at that information as if it were files
- Each process gets a directory named by its PID: `/proc/802/`, `/proc/1234/`, etc.

## Why check `/proc/802/fd/`?

You do this to **see what files a process has open** without killing it or interfering with it.

**Your specific output shows:**

```
0 -> /dev/pts/0    # stdin (keyboard input) - connected to terminal
1 -> /dev/pts/0    # stdout (normal output) - connected to terminal  
2 -> /dev/pts/0    # stderr (error output) - connected to terminal
255 -> /dev/pts/0  # bash-specific (script/shell descriptor)
77 -> /home/admin/somefile  # File descriptor 77 is writing to somefile
```

## Real-world use cases:

**1. File is "busy" and you can't delete it:**
```bash
rm somefile
# Error: file is busy
lsof somefile  # Find what's using it
ls -la /proc/802/fd/  # Confirm it's open
```

**2. Finding log files a daemon is writing to:**
```bash
ls -la /proc/<pid>/fd/ | grep log
```

**3. Finding what ports a web server is listening on:**
```bash
ls -la /proc/802/fd/ | grep socket
```

**4. Debugging "too many open files" errors:**
```bash
ls /proc/802/fd/ | wc -l  # Count how many files are open
```

## In your case:

Bash process 802 has file descriptor **77** open for writing to `/home/admin/somefile`. This means:
- Something like `exec 77> somefile` was run
- Or a script is redirecting to it
- The file handle is still open even though nothing might be actively writing

Does this make sense now? Were you troubleshooting something specific?
