## Mutex
mutual exclusion (mutex) is locking mechanism that ensures only 1 thread can access a shared resource at a time. Its like synchronised
but while it is similar in *providing mutual exclusion and prevents race conditions, mutex is more flexibile with ReentrantLock.

## Semaphore
Synchronisation tool to control access to *single/multiple resources*. And it controls multiple threads unlike mutex.
