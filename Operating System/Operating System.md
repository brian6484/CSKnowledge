## OS
OS is the entire software layer that manages hardware resources and provides service to applications. It consists of

### kernel
- core part that manages CPU, memory, processes and hardware communication
- its like the *engine of OS* that manages low-level hardware interaction, process scheduling, memory management

### systme libraries
- apis that applications use to interact with the kernel

### user interface/shell
- cli or gli for user to interact with system

### utitlities & services
- background programs like file managers, loggers

## analogy 
kernel = engine of car
OS = engine + windows + wheels
