## Program
What exactly is a program?

Program is a set of instructions in a programming language
that is stored in a storage device like a hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD). It has 2 states - dormant which means 
static in storage device and not executed yet. It is not yet loaded into memory - which means OS has not yet dedicated some memory space
for this specific program to run. It needs this before it can be executed.

But when a program is allocated memory space and is executed, it is executed by the computer's Central
Processing Unit (CPU) and is loaded into the Random Access Memory (RAM) from the storage device. The CPU then 
interprets and executes the instructions in the program. The temporary nature of memory with RAM allows for faster 
access to data and more efficient execution, *rather than directly running from a storage device*.
